title: "Episode 1: Arrival in Nyanzaru"

(Played 11 January 2022)

## Summary
The famed but aging adventurer Syndra Sylvane invited to her home two people,
neither of whom came with full knowledge of what was happening.
A (insert class and name of Adrian's character), already worried about the
current disrupted state of the flow of souls across the world,
was easy to convince to join.
Additionally, a Clerk of the Gnosis, (insert name of Parth's character) arrived with
a message from the Rector of the Clerks, an old colleague to Sylvane.
The contents of the message were not revealed to the party, but convinced Sylvane to include
the Clerk in an expedition into Chult to investigate, and perhaps resolve, a death curse.
The beginnings of the Party shortly found themselves on the busy harbor-side streets of
Port Nyanzaru, courtesy of Sylvane's teleportation magic.

(Adrian) struggled briefly under the sweltering Chultan heat and after-effects of teleportation,
but quickly found his feet.
The party entered the Grand Souk, Nyanzaru's main bazaar, and met two new members
while picking up some tea for Sylvane.
Doomguide Isidoros had arrived in Chult less than a week before, already searching for leads on the death curse.
Herb Gimbly, Wizard and *definitely not* an old flame to "Cinder-blocks" Sylvane, chose to join the growing group to prove his eternal superiority over her.

The party grew further in the villa of merchant-prince Wakanga O'tamu, to include
(Jon's cleric), a Bird-barian named Krok, and a baby owlbear sorceror.

The party settled on a plan for an initial expedition:
they would travel up the Tiryki river, then cross the jungle overland towards Kir Sabaal, Krok's home.
This would enable the use of the Bird-person settlement as a staging area for further expeditions,
while leading the party through areas of documented, unusual undead activity.
Traveling across the city to aquire supplies,
the party encountered Vergil's Goliath biker gang, and enraged them by tipping their pigs.
This "problem", however, was quickly resolved by Herb's Fireball.
Among the ashes, Isidoros performed a rite for the departed pig,
preventing her from being raised into abominable undeath and smoothing her
into the next life.

The party visited the villa of merchant prince Ekene-Afa, who was impressed with Krok's wrestling ability
(Krok, though seeming similiarly *impressed*, was less direct).
The party aquired weapons, and a contant for river-boat rental, Tex.
