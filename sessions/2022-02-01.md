title: "Episode 3: On the road to Beluarian"

(Played 01 and 08 February 2022)

## Summary
Upon waking up and convening in Prince Wakanga's villa,
the party finalized a plan for the next days.
First, they should visit Fort Beluarian.
This would serve two purposes:
First, intelligence could be gathered from people with direct knowledge of 
the current state of operations against the undead menace across Chult.
Second, the situation with Shoggo the rogue guide and the dyeing man could
be resolved.
After this, final preparations could be made for an expedition up the Tiryiki River,
to scout near Camps Righteous and Vengeance.
This path is towards the undead danger,
but also useful scouting towards (name of fasist dwarf's home).

(There's a sidequest to take a priest up this way ... let's not forget him)

The party set out to Beluarian by ferry.
The Dragon Turtle visited the party and recieved its toll from most members.
(Adrian), however, decided to take a swim.

On the final walk towards Beluarian,
the party was ambushed by goblins.
They employed the tactic of stacking soldiers into towers 5 goblins tall,
but the party successfully fought them off.

In order to ensure that they properly propogated through the cycle, Isidoros
cremated the fallen goblin soldiers.
This prompted (Will save of yet unknokwn purpose).
