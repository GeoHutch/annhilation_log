## Backstory

Raised in a convent dedicated to the Queen-in-Shadow (the vampiric aspect of the Queen of Death), Isidoros was insulated from the chaos that gripped much of the world when Tiamat's wrath came to the Velt.
He had a few honorary siblings (other refugee children taken in by the nuns) but no concept of normal family life to miss. However, he always found himself bothered by the presence of the undead servants and guards around the convent. Weren't these all souls being trapped out of the Queen's mission of redemption and eventual reincarnation? How could the nuns teach about the Queen's role as guarantor of a fair death and a place in the cycle of souls when one might be taken out of the cycle simply for the convenience of her supposed faithful? Explanations about the necessity to hide the Queen from Tiamat's wrath rang even more hollow after the King of Life ascended to divinity. Now, the cycle of souls had a guarantor at both ends, one to make death fair and redemption in purgatory swift, and one to craft the returns of souls in reincarnated bodies.

Dissatisfied, three of the children, Isidoros, Theoktiste, and Hypatios snuck out of the convent under cover of darkness. They wandered for some time through the wilderness before a chance encounter with a Winter Knight and his faithful dog, traveling to hunt down a squad of soldiers killed on their mission to destroy a dam, and now returned as revenants with an unyielding desire to complete their mission and flood the now-peaceful valley. Isidoros tried to lead a normal life for a time, but felt the call to shepherd the cycle of existence in material world, and became an squire to the Winter Knight order of Doomguides, dedicated to both the Queen and King.

A mission to the undead-plauged land of Chult is the final trial for Knight-aspirant Isidoros. The recent political shifts in the land, combined with strange divinations, has caused suspicion among the Winter Knights, but has not yet risen to the level of taking resources away from the planned Crusade in . Thus, an aspirant is all the could be spared. Isidoros is on a mission to discover the true nature of the undead problem in Chult, and the degree of complicity of the government, while acting as a proper Winter Knight and shepherding the dying, dead, and grieving through the cycle.
